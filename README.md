## Plan

1. Finish Project MVP

2. Refine and refactor until satisfied (mabye ;) )

3. add prototypes, component structure, and update readme

4. add a video for representing what have been done

## To Do

0. tools and dependencies
1. Component structure & organization
2. Logic & state management
3. UI Design / Style + (media queries)
4. Accessibility
5. Testing
6. Documentation

## Key Notes

- Polymorphism (using props) vs inheritance (using components).
- structure code as logical and intuitive as possible.
